# Project-Stock-Portfolio-Optimization
This project performs an in-sample optimisation of trading portfolios, based on the stocks which have been in the S&amp;P500 between 1993 and 2019.

The four key questions that were planned to be answered in this project are:
1. What patterns and insights can be uncovered from historical price data?
2. How can investors use past performance to predict future trends and risks?
3. In what ways does analyzing past data help in building stronger, optimized portfolios?
4. How can different investor needs be addressed through data-driven strategies?
